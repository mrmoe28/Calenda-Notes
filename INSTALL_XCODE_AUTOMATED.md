# Automated Xcode Installation Guide

## What I Can Do

I cannot directly install Xcode (requires App Store and admin access), but I can:

1. ✅ **Check if Xcode is already installed**
2. ✅ **Set up all automation scripts** (already done)
3. ✅ **Configure Xcode once installed** (will do automatically)
4. ✅ **Test the build system** (will do automatically)

## Installation Options

### Option 1: App Store (Recommended)
1. Open **App Store** on your Mac
2. Search for **"Xcode"**
3. Click **"Get"** or **"Install"**
4. Wait for download (can take 30-60 minutes, ~12GB)

### Option 2: Developer Website
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
2. Download Xcode
3. Install the .xip file

## After Installation

Once Xcode is installed, I will automatically:
1. Detect it
2. Configure xcode-select
3. Accept the license
4. Test the build system
5. Start automated clean/build cycles

## What Happens Next

After you install Xcode, just let me know and I'll:
- ✅ Automatically configure everything
- ✅ Run the first clean + build
- ✅ Fix any errors found
- ✅ Set up full automation

**The system is ready - just needs Xcode installed!**
